If row n contains s, then any row m that contains n also contains s. Constructing the subsets of size s for the set of size m can be done by applying the construction for subsets of size s for the set of size n to the subsets of size n in the construction of the subsets of size n for the set of size m.
For any s in row n: (s-1)|(n-1) and s(s-1)|n(n-1) and (s^2 - s + 1 <= n or s = n).
2 is the first term of every row.
if s-1 is prime then is in row s^2 - s + 1.
s is in row s.
If s is prime and in row n, s is in row sn.
T(13,2)=3; T(15,2)=3; and T(19,2)=3; are the only terms not given by the above rules.
The first 2 terms of this sequence is the only run with length greater than 1.
The last term of every row n is n, corresponding to the set S = {{1..n}}.
The first term of every row n is A161680(n)=n*(n-1)/2, corresponding to the set of all unordered pairs in {1..n}.
Row 2 is the only row of length 1.
Conjecture: (s-1)|(n-1) and s(s-1)|n(n-1) and s^2 - s + 1 <= n implies s is in row n.
Later terms may be useful in cloud computing as if the goal of the program is to compare every element of some set to every other the same set, the cardinality of that set gives the row of this sequence that contains all possible numbers of elements of the set that each batch sent out could contain if all batches are the same size and comparisons aren't repeated.
To construct the subsets of size s for the set {1..n} where n = s^2 or n = s^2 - s +1, create a sequence of subsets where each term in the sequence is the lexicographically first subset that does not contain a pair of numbers found in a previous term until no more subsets meet that requirement.
Let Z(n,k) be the set of all possible S described by T(n,k).
Given i, j, k, m and n such that T(n,k) != 2 and T(m,j) and T(m,j) = T(n,k)+1 = T(n+m,i), there is no element Z, of Z(n+m,i), such that there is exists an element N of Z(n,k) and an element M of Z(m,j) such that for every set A in N, A U z is in Z for some z in {n+1..n+m} (z can differ for each A), and for every set B in M, {b+n|there exists b in B} is in Z. Less rigorously, given a set N in Z(n,k), and a set M in Z(m,j) where the elements are subsets of {m+1..n}, where the is size of a set in N is 1 less than for M, one cannot construct an element of Z(m+n,l) where T(m+n,l)=T(m,j) by taking the union of M and N with each of the sets in N having an element of {n+1..m} added to it so that all the pairs between sub-elements of N and M exist.
Conjecture: every set S for a given T(n,k) can be transformed into any other set of subsets for T(n,k) by applying a bijective mapping of {1..n} to {1..n} to each element of each set in S, This is known to hold for the first and last element of each row.

Subsets of cardinality 2 works for {1, 2, 3, 4} so 2 is in row 4:

  {1, 4}
  {2, 3}
  {2, 4}
  {3, 4}
Subsets of cardinality 5 works for {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} so 5 is in row 5:
  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Subsets of cardinality 3 works for {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} so 3 is in row 7:
